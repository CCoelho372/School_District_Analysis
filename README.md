# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

###### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the effects of Thomas' High School ninth graders on the school's overall math, reading, and overall passing percentage. An analysis was made to show the difference in school metrics when ninth graders were included and removed from the school's key quality indicators.

## Results

**District Summary**

*There was not much difference between the district summary of the ninth graders being removed and the with them included. The ninth graders of Thomas High School are such a small number of students compared to the district as a whole there is not likely to be a significant difference seen here.*

*School summary maintained similarities as well*

**Thomas High School Relative Performance**

% Passing Math - 66.9%
% Passing Reading - 69.7%
% Passing Overall - 65.1%

*About the same in each analysis.*

**Ninth Grade Score Effect**

*These scores were relatively the same*

*Scores varied by a tenth of a percent.*

## Summary
*In most all of these cases having ninth-grade scores counted and not counted provided little change in the overall outcomes of the school. In each case it was in the top five in overall passing. There is little evidence to show that there was significant academic dishonesty. Most cases when rounding occured to the tenth percent or to a whole integer the differences were not noticed.*
